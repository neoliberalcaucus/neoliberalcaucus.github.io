<h2>Closing the Door on Tom Woods</h2>
<h3>Part 1: The Crying Nazi</h3>
<p>This article series is in response to Tom Woods' "Woods Derangement Syndrome" article. Woods' full article can be read <a href="https://tomwoods.com/woods-derangement-syndrome/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Woods' responses are in red (I add underlines for emphasis occasionally). Any other outside quotes used are in green.</p>
<p><strong>Complaint: &ldquo;At least once hosted neo-nazi Christopher Cantwell (&lsquo;the crying nazi') on his podcast, saying to him &lsquo;You have been saying a lot of the things that I wish I could say, but for diplomatic reasons and for the fact that I'm too busy to open up more civil wars&hellip;You're doing very important work.'&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>First, the full response:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This accusation is particularly evil.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When I had Chris Cantwell on my show in 2014 (precisely once; I don't know why the words &ldquo;at least once&rdquo; would be used), <em>he was still a regular host on Free Talk Live</em>, for heaven's sake. Unless we're now going to ramp the hysteria level up to 11 and accuse the Free State Project of white supremacy, this would appear to be a relevant consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ian Freeman, who runs Free Talk Live, is the last person on earth even a hysteric would call a &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Nazi,&rdquo; which is why no one has bothered trying. And Ian says of Chris, &ldquo;Until the last year or two of his life, he'd been a libertarian activist with no known racist streak.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cantwell appears to have shifted toward white nationalism around 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are expecting me to divine the direction someone would take years after his appearance with me, or for me to know a guest better than his own daily co-host does, I think you are being a trifle unfair to the host of a five-day-per-week podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now let's get to that quotation from me. This will show you how little honor my critics have, honor evidently being another outdated right-wing institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The obvious intention of the quotation attributed to me is to make it sound as if I was speaking in 2014 to the Cantwell of 2017 and saying, &ldquo;Thank goodness you're saying all the anti-Semitic things I wish I could say, Chris!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">That's obviously why the dates are never included. It is a deliberate attempt to insinuate sinister motives on my part.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It leaves you in shock that people of such bad will could exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The present chairman of the Libertarian National Committee even pulled this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Never explained is: why would I have said such a thing in public? Saying <em>I wish I could utter anti-Semitic statements so I'm glad you're doing it for me</em> is only about three percent better than actually uttering them myself, so what would have been the point of publicly saying something like this? Their story makes no sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What I obviously meant &mdash; <em>and which is immediately clear from listening to the episode </em>&mdash; was that I was glad Chris had written a series of articles in 2014 against some not particularly bright critics whom I myself had no particular desire to fight with, but whose arguments needed to be answered. He could call people out in ways I couldn't, since had I done so I would have inadvertently launched various institutional civil wars.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now make no mistake: the Loser Brigade obviously knows this. They are simply trying to destroy me. (That's too dramatic, probably: opposition from these folks is like pebbles thrown at the Washington Monument, so if you're concerned for me, don't be.) They likewise know I would never behave in this ends-justify-the-means way toward them in return, because I am a decent person with principles.</span></p>
<p>I will be responding to the parts that are mostly objective (not opinionated) and meaningful (not listing credentials or sentences solely attacking critics without a real argument).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When I had Chris Cantwell on my show in 2014 (precisely once; I don't know why the words &ldquo;at least once&rdquo; would be used), <em>he was still a regular host on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Talk Live</span></em>, for heaven's sake. Unless we're now going to ramp the hysteria level up to 11 and accuse the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free State Project</span> of white supremacy, this would appear to be a relevant consideration.</span></p>
<p>Woods conflates Free Talk Live, which did host Cantwell, with the Free State Project. The Free State Project has been adamant that Free Talk Live is not a part of their organization, and in 2015 they fully disassociated, ending even the marketing relationship they had with them. They <a href="https://www.fsp.org/free-state-project-statement-regarding-ian-freeman-and-free-talk-live/">put out a statement</a> at that time which included:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"Dissolving this relationship reinforces the existing reality that the FSP and FTL (and Ian's other organizations such as Free Keene and Liberty Radio Network) are different organizations, with different missions and standards, that should not be conflated with each other."</span></p>
<p>Ian Freeman, who hosts Free Talk Live, <a href="https://www.fsp.org/team/fsp-board-minutes/">was banned</a> from Free State Project events.</p>
<p>The Free State Project <a href="https://independentpoliticalreport.com/2013/09/chris-cantwell-and-the-free-state-project/">also banned Cantwell</a> from attending any of their events and removed him as a participant on September 3, 2013, for promoting violence (Cantwell was on the Tom Woods show on May 14, 2014). Woods knew that the Free State Project banned Cantwell for promoting violence. Cantwell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=27m6s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">told him</a> on the podcast episode.</p>
<p>Woods also exaggerates this complaint. Having Cantwell as a host does not prove that Free Talk Live or Woods supports white supremacy, but it is worthy of criticism and could be used in addition to other pieces of evidence to support a stronger claim. I will go far more into the Cantwell timeline later, but it should give some pause that one of the two organizations Woods cites banned Cantwell for his violent rhetoric months before Woods had him on.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ian Freeman, who runs Free Talk Live, is the last person on earth even a hysteric would call a &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Nazi,&rdquo; which is why no one has bothered trying. And Ian says of Chris, &ldquo;Until the last year or two of his life, he'd been a libertarian activist with no known racist streak.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cantwell appears to have shifted toward white nationalism around 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are expecting me to divine the direction someone would take years after his appearance with me, or for me to know a guest better than his own daily co-host does, I think you are being a trifle unfair to the host of a five-day-per-week podcast.</span></p>
<p>Woods published this article in late 2019, so it may seem to the unsuspecting observer that Freeman's statement ("last year or two") supports Woods' claim that the shift appeared to have started in 2017. But Freeman made this statement in August 2017. Freeman <a href="https://freekeene.com/2017/08/16/the-curious-case-of-christopher-cantwell/">says in his statement</a> that Cantwell "began down this road to his current skinhead-racist form" at the same time as he was kicked off Free Talk Live, and that this was why he was kicked off. Cantwell was booted from Free Talk Live for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170820032924/https://christophercantwell.com/2017/08/17/consider-alt-right/">comments supporting race realism</a> in their Facebook group in September 2015. Free Talk Live made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freetalklive/posts/10153190830064072">public announcement</a> on September 19.</p>
<p>If Woods should not know better than Cantwell's own co-host, then Woods should be using the 2015 date, not 2017.</p>
<p>It's possible that Woods recognized the awkward implications of fully accepting Freeman's story. Cantwell was kicked from the show for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170820032924/https://christophercantwell.com/2017/08/17/consider-alt-right/">arguing in favor</a> of some comments Stefan Molyneux made on race realism. And Woods has had Molyneux on his show several times after this incident (much more on Molyneux in a later article). Or perhaps 2015 is too close to the podcast episode date for comfort.</p>
<p>Freeman is not as good a source as Woods implies. Freeman has a clear bias here; he can hardly say that Cantwell's racism was clear <em>while he was still a host</em>.</p>
<p>Freeman's story also contradicts his own actions. Cantwell had been <a href="https://toddandrewbarnett.com/2015/05/24/christopher-cantwells-public-relations-and-political-downfall-on-the-heels-of-his-racist-fueled-twitter-tweet-and-so-on/">suspended indefinitely</a> from Free Talk Live for a racist comment in May 2015. He can hardly argue that Cantwell had no racist streak during a time when he himself had suspended Cantwell for racism.</p>
<p>Woods' story of the shift starting in 2017 is flatly absurd. As soon as Cantwell was removed from Free Talk Live, he almost completely unrestrained himself. Three days after Free Talk Live announced his removal, on September 22, 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919134740/https://christophercantwell.com/2015/09/22/my-chat-with-therightstuff-biz/">went on The Right Stuff's The Daily Shoah podcast</a>, a neo-Nazi podcast, where he talked favorably on white nationalism. 2015 was not the start of his shift to his current neo-Nazi form, as Freeman would have us believe, it was near the completion.</p>
<p>This was not Cantwell's first interaction with The Right Stuff. His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318053342/http://christophercantwell.com/2014/06/02/still-debating-non-aggression-principle/">first mention of the site</a> was on June 2, 2014, just a few weeks after his episode with Woods. There he responded to an argument they made on the Non-Aggression Principle, and commenting on the website itself said, "other than some inexplicable distaste for Cop Block, I usually enjoy [it] immensely". So it seems his biggest problem with neo-Nazis was that they didn't hate cops.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are expecting me to divine the direction someone would take years after his appearance with me, or for me to know a guest better than his own daily co-host does, I think you are being a trifle unfair to the host of a five-day-per-week podcast.</span></p>
<p>Cantwell's racist rhetoric was known by Woods before the podcast episode in May 2014. Antonio Buehler <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioBuehler/status/396305849695490048">tweeted Woods</a> on November 1, 2013, about a child molestation joke Cantwell made, asking why Woods' followed Cantwell. Woods took this as an attack, and Woods and Buehler engaged in a short argument over the issue. The topic soon moved to Cantwell's usage of slurs and racist jokes.</p>
<p>When Buehler mentioned Cantwell calling President Obama the n-word, Woods said he was not a fan of Cantwell's "style", but "I am far less a fan of obsessive p.c. hysterics and monitors".</p>
<p>Buehler also mentioned that Cantwell made racist jokes, and Woods seemed to be familiar with this, as he responded, "I am not a Cantwell fan, but I am even less a fan of obsessives and endless cries of 'racism.'" When Buehler pressed him on the issue, Woods responded, "You are making me like the guy."</p>
<p>On the podcast with Cantwell, Woods was reminded of this conversation. When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=13m59s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Woods asked Cantwell</a> about which people were most responsible for "muddy[ing] what the libertarian message is supposed to be all about" and pushing an "egalitarian agenda", Cantwell immediately mentioned, "Well, right now, I remember your epic Twitter battle with Antonio Buehler".</p>
<p>Woods also indicated on the podcast that he followed Cantwell on Facebook - he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=1m&amp;bpctr=9999999999">praised Cantwell</a> for "how many Facebook shares you're getting". It is unlikely Woods missed all of the racist and sexist posts.</p>
<p>Woods has also been informed more recently. A popular image shows Cantwell using the n-word to refer to Trayvon Martin on Twitter in 2013 displayed next to Woods' quote praising Cantwell (although the date should be 2014 for that quote, not 2015). Talib Kweli Greene, a well-known rapper, <a href="https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/1030969359706009601">tweeted</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/1037390278364225536">it</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/1030946612695248896">at</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/1030953402304524290">Woods</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/1030903296524017664">numerous</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/1030929917192663045">times</a> during a Twitter feud between the two in August 2018. Woods would later <a href="https://tomwoods.com/how-i-made-talib-kweli-into-my-unpaid-marketing-intern/">reference</a> <a href="https://tomwoods.com/left-wing-rapper-gives-me-early-christmas-present/">the</a> <a href="https://tomwoods.com/ep-1223-how-to-profit-off-your-enemies-tears/">feud</a> <a href="https://tomwoods.com/ep-1225-eric-july-on-libertarianism-the-black-community-and-dealing-with-critics/">multiple</a> <a href="https://tomwoods.com/the-war-on-woods-just-picked-up-steam/">times</a> on his website and podcast. The "Woods Derangement Syndrome" article was written not long after, on December 19, 2019.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The obvious intention of the quotation attributed to me is to make it sound as if I was speaking in 2014 to the Cantwell of 2017 and saying, &ldquo;Thank goodness you're saying all the anti-Semitic things I wish I could say, Chris!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">That's obviously why the dates are never included. It is a deliberate attempt to insinuate sinister motives on my part.</span></p>
<p>This is mostly a matter of subjective interpretation, so I won't go deeply into it.</p>
<p>When I use the quote, it's very much insinuating that Woods supported the Cantwell of 2014, a violent, racist, misogynistic harasser. And the motive is to both show that this was wrong in of itself and that Woods had horrible judgment. If you praise the racial positions of someone who people warn you is racist and mock the idea that racism is a serious issue with that person on your show, and then they become an openly white nationalist shortly after, it should be a warning sign that you are doing something very wrong. And it is worthy of serious criticism, particularly if you show no sign of learning from it.</p>
<p>As for dates, as said earlier, the most popular image on the issue includes dates, which Woods has almost certainly seen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What I obviously meant &mdash; <em>and which is immediately clear from listening to the episode </em>&mdash; was that I was glad Chris had written a series of articles in 2014 against some not particularly bright critics whom I myself had no particular desire to fight with, but whose arguments needed to be answered. He could call people out in ways I couldn't, since had I done so I would have inadvertently launched various institutional civil wars.</span></p>
<p>Woods <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=2m21s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">specifically</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/FDGrYXqjpWA?t=845">requests</a> Cantwell to call-out people on his podcast, and Woods himself <a href="https://youtu.be/FDGrYXqjpWA?t=362&amp;bpctr=9999999999">calls-out</a> Max Borders.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"So, lately, I don't mind mentioning names, because I think there's too much walking on eggshells, too much tip-toeing around, I don't mind mentioning names about who's causing some of these problems"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"I want you to name me some names. I want you to tell me, in your opinion, who these days is most responsible for trying to push an egalitarian agenda onto the libertarian movement and muddy what the libertarian message is supposed to be all about. Give me some names."</span></p>
<p>It seems his interest in avoiding infighting (which he <a href="https://youtu.be/FDGrYXqjpWA?t=155">argues in favor of</a>, and asks Cantwell to argue in favor of, during the podcast) is more of a gimmick than a reality.</p>
<p>Woods does not specify who these libertarian critics are or what the critiques are, but we can get a rough idea by who Cantwell and Woods mention during the podcast, the discussions during the podcast, and who Cantwell wrote articles on in the couple months before the podcast. On the podcast:</p>
<p>Mentioned by Woods: <a href="https://youtu.be/FDGrYXqjpWA?t=362&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Max Borders</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=16m28s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Cathy Reisenwitz</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=21m05s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Cathy Reisenwitz (again)</a></p>
<p>Mentioned by Cantwell: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=14m24s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Antonio Buehler</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=14m47s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Steve Horwitz</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=14m49s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Jeffrey Tucker</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=15m57s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Cathy Reisenwitz</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGrYXqjpWA&amp;t=22m59s&amp;bpctr=9999999999">Cathy Reisenwitz (again)</a></p>
<p>Reisenwitz was the only one given a long discussion, and brought up multiple times.</p>
<p>About half the podcast is race-related, with the rest being split between privilege (with no specific mention of race), people messing with what libertarianism should be, and infighting. In context, it very much seems like "muddying the waters" is referring to people wanting libertarianism to oppose racism/sexism, and that the infighting is over this issue.</p>
<p>The table below is a count of posts Cantwell made on various people on his website. It is based on titles and article tags, and only includes people who are libertarians (or at least were at the time) and posts between the period of March 1, 2014, and the podcast date, May 14. Excluding the people Cantwell speaks positively on (such as Lew Rockwell), we have:</p>

<p>As the only person who is referenced by both Woods and Cantwell on the podcast, discussed by far the most on the podcast, and discussed by far the most on Cantwell's blog during this period, it can be safely assumed that Reisenwitz is one of the critics Woods was referring to.</p>
<p>14 out of the 15 posts Cantwell made on Reisenwitz discuss racism. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170815183213/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/05/08/video-women-want-libertarian-movement/">only post that does not</a> is a video about "what women want from the libertarian movement", not an article. The video is no longer available, but the post is tagged with "gender roles" and "humor", so one can surmise the general idea.</p>
<p>One such article published in mid-March, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140522233939/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/03/18/left-libertarians-worse-racists/">Left Libertarians Are Worse Than Racists</a>", declared left-libertarians such as Reisenwitz and Buehler to be the real racists, because "[t]hey view the world through racial terms and take gender into consideration at every pass". Cantwell complains that "the left libertarian says 'I must fix this racial inequality' even if only to damn the prosperity of white males", and concludes his "Left Libertarians are Racists" section with:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"So the goal isn't really egalitarianism, they just hate white males, or more accurately, they hate good shit."</span></p>
<p>This is typical of Cantwell's articles on race and gender. Even in articles that seem like they should be totally unrelated to race or gender, Cantwell finds a way to bring the issue up. In "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170815200635/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/04/25/libertarian-feminism-isnt-brave-hipster/">'Libertarian Feminism' Isn't Brave, Hipster</a>", he manages to fit in that "the 'racist Ron Paul newsletters'" were "in reality a non-event", that Reisenwitz supports "reverse racism", and that Reisenwitz should challenge the "race and sex propaganda".</p>
<p>Reisenwitz has <a href="https://www.cathyreisenwitz.com/history-christopher-cantwell/">written a detailed article</a> on her interactions with Cantwell, and I strongly recommend reading it for a more in-depth look. An excerpt:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"Cantwell's beef with me (along with Jeffrey Tucker, SFL, BHL, and 'the rest') was that we advocated for libertarianism to explicitly reject white nationalism. 'She's one of many race baiting liberal snobs who goes out of her way to make libertarianism look bad by calling it racist, sexist, homophobic, evil white male rape culture etc.'</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">He would call me a 'race-pimp' while blogging about how libertarianism is absolutely not opposed to racism or misogyny."</span></p>
<p>Woods mostly focuses on racism and antisemitism in his response, but violence is another key aspect of neo-Nazis. Reisenwitz discusses Cantwell's more violent nature in her article:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"For years, Cantwell would create social media accounts with which he'd harass me. I'd block them, and he would create more accounts, harass me, and I would block those accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">Until last week I have mostly ignored Cantwell. I ignored him because I was afraid. I was afraid because he was a violent, deranged man who would not leave me alone. I was afraid that talking about him would make him even more obsessed with me. I was also afraid talking about him would grow his considerable audience, who also harassed me, and lend his views legitimacy."</span></p>
<p>Reisenwitz was right to be concerned. As mentioned earlier, Cantwell was banned from the Free State Project for promoting violence. Even Ian Freeman <a href="https://freekeene.com/2012/06/30/keenes-not-right-for-everyone-especially-advocates-of-violence/">refused to allow Cantwell to write</a> for his Free Keene website, because of Cantwell's support for violence.</p>
<p>Cantwell's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227130503/http://www.christophercantwell.com/2013/09/03/porcupine-non-grata/">theory on self-defense</a> was that a person could use "whatever level of force necessary" to prevent what he considers aggression or get restitution for that aggression. The Free State Project originally took issue with a comment Cantwell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228103258/https://christophercantwell.com/2013/09/02/transcript-jody-underwood-threatens-to-remove-chris-cantwell-from-fsp-participants/">had made</a> where he said, "It's a terribly unpopular thing to say, but the answer, at some point, is to kill government agents". On August 9, 2013, the Free State Project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228103258/https://christophercantwell.com/2013/09/02/transcript-jody-underwood-threatens-to-remove-chris-cantwell-from-fsp-participants/">asked Cantwell</a> to "remove that statement advocating violence and assure us in writing that you won't promote violence". Cantwell refused. When asked to clarify what he meant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228103258/https://christophercantwell.com/2013/09/02/transcript-jody-underwood-threatens-to-remove-chris-cantwell-from-fsp-participants/">Cantwell responded</a>, on August 27:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"For me personally, all government agents are paid through coercive means, so from a purely philosophical angle, any level of force necessary for anyone to stop any government agent from furthering said coercion is morally justifiable."</span></p>
<p>On his blog on September 2, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140228103258/https://christophercantwell.com/2013/09/02/transcript-jody-underwood-threatens-to-remove-chris-cantwell-from-fsp-participants/">Cantwell wrote</a>:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"That statement was not the first, and will not be the last time I advocate defensive force against government agents, or any other class of criminal, that opts to use violence against peaceful people. I will not remove it, and I think it troubling that the FSP would send a blogger such a demand."</span></p>
<p>On September 3, after being removed, Cantwell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227130503/http://www.christophercantwell.com/2013/09/03/porcupine-non-grata/">wrote a long article in response</a>, where he brought up some examples of people who he had the right to murder. These included someone stealing a paperclip, the mailman, and a little girl picking a flower on his property.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"This lead to a philosophical discussion on the use of force to protect property, where it was posed to me by Jason Talley 'Do you have the right to shoot someone over a paperclip?'. Sure, why not? It's my paperclip, he stole it, I have the right to defend and retrieve my property using whatever level of force is necessary. Now, shooting someone over a paperclip seems like a waste of a bullet, and the cleaning costs would surely be astronomical especially if we were on a carpeted floor."</span></p>
<p>Cantwell would <a href="https://toddandrewbarnett.com/2014/04/20/my-response-to-free-talk-lives-ian-freemans-on-air-response-to-my-comments-on-christopher-cantwells-blog-post-open-letter-to-the-free-state-project-board/">later accuse</a> Jody Underwood, a member of the Free State Project board, of calling him a domestic terrorist during this incident.</p>
<p>Cantwell would soon become even more extreme on the issue, backing away from even some of the practical issues with it. On November 5, 2013, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301182310/http://www.christophercantwell.com/2013/11/05/at-least-paul-ciancia-wasnt-a-sheep/">Cantwell wrote about Paul A. Ciancia</a>, who was responsible for a shooting on November 1 at the Los Angeles International Airport. One TSA employee was killed, two other TSA employees were shot, and one schoolteacher was shot. Cantwell was ecstatic. "I'm cheering for Paul Ciancia", he wrote,</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"No innocent people were hurt when 23 year old Paul A. Ciancia opened fire on the rapists and pedophiles who wear the uniform of the Transportation Security Administration. The New Jersey native went to Los Angeles International Airport with a mission, to kill government agents who habitually assault, molest, kidnap, rob, and harass their fellow man for a paycheck of stolen money. He succeeded, and I'm glad he did. ... there's very few people who don't know, on some level, that what Paul did was inevitable, necessary, and just. ... My only hope is that when, not if, when, others take the path of Paul Ciancia, they put some more planning into their mission, and avoid being killed or captured. I hope that they recruit others to assist them, and strike a more debilitating blow..."</span></p>
<p>In an article on March 15, 2014, titled "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140317235045/http://www.christophercantwell.com/2014/03/15/violently-overthrow-the-government/">Violently Overthrow The Government</a>", Cantwell wrote:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"My proposal, and in all honesty, I'm still working out the details, has been to resort to force. For free men and women to forcefully defend themselves against agents of the State. To kill government agents who would otherwise use force against them, until their jobs simply become so dangerous that they seek other lines of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. That has always been, and always will be, the case. Who the terrorists are and who the good guys are is a thing sorted out by history through body counts."</span></p>
<p>His articles on Carla Gericke, president of the Free State Project at the time, and Jody Underwood, a board member at the time, are over the Free State Project and his anger at being banned.</p>
<p>Cantwell did not stick solely to theory. He publically admitted to going after libertarian activists, including Reisenwitz. On May 12, just two days before the Woods podcast, Cantwell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170816053500/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/05/12/bitcoin-magazine-stands-cathy-reisenwitz/">posted on his website</a> that he had messaged Bitcoin Magazine, a magazine Reisenwitz wrote for, telling them to "publicly distance itself from [Reisenwitz]". In early March, after Reisenwitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318064245/http://christophercantwell.com/2014/03/03/cathy-reisenwitz-accuses-bitcoin-bigotry-loses-2-klout-points/">tweeted about Bitcoin</a> being mainly used by white males and asking if privilege applies to Bitcoin, Michael Shanklin wrote:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"At first I didn't understand why Chris Cantwell was so anti-her.... but after doing the research, this bitch has got to go. I will do what I can with Christopher Cantwell to get this communist/terrorist fired from any freedom organization so they can't distort the message/ruin freedom for the rest of us anymore."</span></p>
<p>On the episode itself, Cantwell refused to name Reisenwitz, instead engaging in hinted insults. Cantwell brought her up by calling her an "obscure blogger" featured at Liberty Fest NYC, going on to calling her a "left-wing lunatic". Woods played along, laughing, just referring to her as "our friend" and "someone of no distinction" and saying that "normal" people don't care about her priorities.</p>
<p>For Antonio Buehler, who was Cantwell's main target before Reisenwitz, Cantwell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170701034057/http://antoniobuehler.org/page/2/">created a fake site</a>, writing under Buehler's name with false and incendiary comments. When someone said Buehler and Cantwell should box for charity, Cantwell refused but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301164343/http://www.christophercantwell.com/2013/12/02/video-what-happens-when-you-confront-internet-tough-guys/">later said to Buehler</a>, "[I]f you want violence, say it just once. I'll give it to you. What you don't get, is the benefit of padded gloves and a referee. Do you want the rules of engagement I give any other violent enemy? You can have them."</p>
<p>Julie Borowski <a href="https://www.cathyreisenwitz.com/history-christopher-cantwell/">wrote on Reisenwitz' post</a> that Cantwell targeted her as well:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"He did the same thing to me. Several nasty blog posts, harassment on social media, legit sexist memes, and he even did a video parody of me."</span></p>
<p>Cantwell went even further against George Geankoplis. Cantwell accused Geankoplis of having people report posts in his Facebook group, Libertarian Brutalism, to Facebook. Cantwell considered this to be a form of aggression (the group being his property), and therefore worthy of any level of violence. On April 25, 2014, Cantwell posted:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"> "I want to know everything we can find about this piece of shit, names, addresses, telephone numbers, extra accounts, family members, everything. There's a secret group I made for this purpose, let me know if you want in."</span></p>
<p>When one person told him not to dox, Cantwell responded, "I'm going to do more than 'dox'". He proceeded to publish Geankoplis' address and phone number, saying "Somebody go knock on that fuckin assholes door" and "Make this fucking scumbag regret this". These posts were received overwhelmingly positively by the Brutalists. Multiple Brutalists claimed to have tried to call Geankoplis. Geankoplis posted that Cantwell "called my house tonight and threatened to kill me" on the 26th.</p>
<p>Cantwell went after numerous lesser-known people as well. On April 26, Cantwell messaged me, claiming I had a "sock puppet" in his Libertarian Brutalism group because I had posted a screenshot from the group to a different group. For this offense, Cantwell said, "[Y]ou're on a list now. Have a wonderful evening, scumbag."</p>
<p>The "Brutalist" term was originally created by Jeffrey Tucker. Tucker wrote the article "<a href="https://fee.org/articles/against-libertarian-brutalism/">Against Libertarian Brutalism</a>" on March 12, 2014. There he wrote that "libertarians can generally be divided into two camps: humanitarians and brutalists", and on the brutalists:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"To them, what's impressive about liberty is that it allows people to assert their individual preferences, to form homogeneous tribes, to work out their biases in action, to ostracize people based on &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo; standards, to hate to their heart's content so long as no violence is used as a means, to shout down people based on their demographics or political opinions, to be openly racist and sexist, to exclude and isolate and be generally malcontented with modernity, and to reject civil standards of values and etiquette in favor of antisocial norms."</span></p>
<p>While Tucker wrote the article in opposition to this mindset, Cantwell and other Brutalists embraced it. On the same day, Cantwell responded "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200421193737/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/03/12/jeffrey-tuckers-case-libertarianism/">Jeffrey Tucker Reduces Core Libertarian Ideals To 'Brutalism'</a>", and that "Mr. Tucker, to his credit, had the decency to acknowledge that we "brutalists" as he calls us, are correct in our assertion that libertarianism itself cares not for aesthetics, or race/gender baiting". Later in the article, he insinuates that Ron Paul's racist newsletters aren't really racist and makes the usual excuses for racism ("Better yet, what is racism, besides that which mentions race or has a disproportionate demographic?").</p>
<p>The others Cantwell had much less interaction with.</p>
<p>Alexander McCobin wrote an article criticizing the Ron Paul Institute, and Cantwell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180312033834/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/03/27/ron-paul-institute-vs-students-liberty/">agreed with most of it</a>, but criticized McCobin (whose name Cantwell misspells) for his association with an organization that was associated with Reisenwitz, and goes on his usual rant about Reisenwitz (although does not tag her). The other article, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170815192904/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/05/12/fake-apologies-race-pimping-worse/">Fake Apologies, or Race Pimping &ndash; Which is Worse?</a>" mentions McCobin only once, and is almost entirely about Reisenwitz.</p>
<p>Steve Horwitz criticized a racist article from Cantwell, where Cantwell mentioned "noticing that Martin Luther King was a black liberal and to celebrate him people take a day off work" (as well as a few other comments from Cantwell), calling Cantwell a racist. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170815184602/https://christophercantwell.com/2014/04/11/steve-horwitz-difference-humor-racism/">Cantwell responded on April 11</a>. Woods has since <a href="https://tomwoods.com/ep-157-libertarianism-hijacked/">claimed that Horwitz never knew who Cantwell was</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Podcast Episode</strong></p>
<p>When Woods asked Cantwell if he had "white male privilege", Cantwell denied having any advantages from being white, and followed up with, "[A]s a matter of fact in some cases I'm actually discriminated against because I'm a white male. So I don't know what it is that they think I'm getting on the strength of my gender and skin color, because I have yet to find it, unfortunately." Woods was quite pleased during Cantwell's response, laughing when Cantwell said he "want[s] to get some of it", and when Cantwell finished, Woods immediately tried to back up Cantwell, saying "And, of course, [white male privilege] is a concept that feeds into all kinds of statist nonsense". He then went into a story on the New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer (whose name he didn't remember until Cantwell helped him out). Woods said,</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">"I'm pretty sure I remember reading some years ago, there was some department store chain in New York that, you know, if they think you're engaging in shoplifting, they ask you to leave. Well, apparently, [the Attorney General] had been spying on this particular chain, and it turned out they had been disproportionately asking black customers to leave. So this is ipso facto evidence of racism. Ipso facto, without even having to investigate it, it just, apparently, shoplifting is equally distributed among the population. Why would that be an a priori judgment, how would we know that without just examining what people do and what exactly happened and what the numbers were in that case?"</span></p>
<p>The department store chain was Macy's. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/nyregion/macys-settles-complaint-of-racial-profiling-for-600000.html">Woods made several errors</a>:</p>
<p>- "ipso facto, without even having to investigate it": They did do an investigation.</p>
<p>- "they ask you to leave": They were questioning, pressuring confessions, fingerprinting, handcuffing, and even detaining customers, sometimes "behind metal bars in a holding cell".</p>
<p>- "how would we know that without just examining what people do and what exactly happened": They did examine it. The stores engaged in racial profiling. Macy's officials even said the procedures in the stores investigated to avoid racial profiling had been "ignored by employees of the stores".</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><span class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">"According to Mr. Spitzer's complaint, blacks and Latinos claimed that they were followed, questioned and searched by security guards in several Macy's stores based solely on the customers' race and ethnicity. </span><span class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Several of the complainants said they were subjected to intrusive searches after security alarms sounded upon their leaving the stores, even though white customers who set off alarms were allowed to leave, according to the complaint."</span></span></p>
<p>- "apparently, shoplifting is equally distributed among the population": They looked at more than just population, the difference could not be "explained by [other] measurable factors":</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><span class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">"With Macy's cooperation, investigators examined security data from 2000 to 2004 from a sample of stores in New York State and found that 75 percent of the detainees were nonwhite, far greater than the percentage of nonwhites arrested by the police for theft in the municipalities surrounding those stores, said Macy's officials and other officials close to the investigation."</span></span></p>
<p>See the New York Times' article: "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/nyregion/macys-settles-complaint-of-racial-profiling-for-600000.html">Macy's Settles Complaint of Racial Profiling for $600,000</a>"</p>
<p>Woods later claimed that Walter Williams, a black libertarian, "gets a free pass" to say discrimination does not explain a lot of economic differences between blacks and whites. Then he asked Cantwell if that free pass has to do with his race, and Cantwell responded that it's "black privilege", to which Woods agreed ("That's what it is, Chris!").</p>
<p>In an attempt to connect this opposition to racism accusations (toward minorities - no mention was made of the harms of Cantwell's reverse racism accusations) to libertarianism, Woods claimed that accusations of racism are "the sort of things that the state uses to destroy people". Soon after he mentioned the Ron Paul newsletters, although whether he was claiming that the Ron Paul newsletters were a government attempt to destroy people is unclear.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Never explained is: why would I have said such a thing in public? Saying <em>I wish I could utter anti-Semitic statements so I'm glad you're doing it for me</em> is only about three percent better than actually uttering them myself, so what would have been the point of publicly saying something like this? Their story makes no sense.</span></p>
<p>The point of the quote is not to show total agreement with Cantwell's racism in 2014 (at least not on its own), rather to show that Woods found the attacks on his enemies to be more important. Woods was willing to endorse a racial position possibly further right than his own in order to attack the racial position to his left. The Twitter thread with Antonio Buehler makes this clear. Woods says he is not a fan of Cantwell's comments but is "even less a fan of obsessives and endless cries of 'racism.'" And when Buehler continues to the left of Woods, Woods is quick to align with Cantwell ("You are making me like the guy"). It is indifference to Cantwell's racism and violence relative to his true enemies on the left.</p>
<p>This is very similar to Cantwell and The Right Stuff in June 2014. It is unlikely that Cantwell was in total agreement with the alt-right at this time. But they shared his hatred of the left and were not too far from his position, and that was enough for him to endorse the website.</p>
<p>Hence how someone could find themselves at a neo-Nazi website after following just two endorsements.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><em>Before (or while) Cantwell was on the Tom Woods show:</em></p>
<p><strong>1) Cantwell was racist</strong></p>
<p>Cantwell frequently used racial slurs to refer to black people, supported black stereotypes (such as that black people don't work), minimized racism in things like the Ron Paul newsletters as a non-event, and argued that reverse racism was the real problem while racism toward minorities "is a non-issue" (calling it "black privilege" during the podcast episode and saying the left was threatening the "prosperity of white males" in an article).</p>
<p><strong>2) Cantwell supported terrorism</strong></p>
<p>Cantwell supported the right to murder government agents, and when a real terrorist attack occurred, called it necessary and just, and hoped that more people would engage in such violence.</p>
<p><strong>3) Cantwell engaged in harassment</strong></p>
<p>Cantwell doxxed one critic, told people to go to his house and make him "regret this", and threatened to kill him. Cantwell engaged in social media harassment to at least two women, using fake accounts to get around blocks. He also made continual efforts to get one of them fired. To another critic, Cantwell created a fake site under his name and pushed for a violent confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>4) Woods was aware of all of the above being true or having a high potential of being true</strong></p>
<p>Woods was told months before that Cantwell was using racial slurs toward black people and engaging in other racist comments. Woods was reminded of this exchange during the podcast episode. Woods also saw many of Cantwell's Facebook posts and articles, where Cantwell made frequent racist comments. And Woods heard Cantwell's view that he had no advantages, only disadvantages, for being white (which he called black privilege) during the podcast.</p>
<p>Woods was made aware that Cantwell was expelled from the Free State Project for advocating violence during the podcast episode. Woods also saw many of Cantwell's Facebook posts and articles, where Cantwell made frequent mention of both his violent views and his expulsion.</p>
<p>Woods saw many of Cantwell's Facebook posts and articles, where Cantwell made frequent vicious attacks on his targets, including insults like "race pimp", a parody video, and attempts to get the one target fired, with the targets showing no interest in engagement. On the podcast itself, both Woods and Cantwell continued these insults toward one target.</p>
<p><strong>5) Woods wanted Cantwell on his show due to his articles discussing race and t</strong><strong>he quote "You have been saying a lot of the things that I wish I could say" is referring to articles Cantwell made discussing race</strong></p>
<p>Woods says this was about articles targeted at "critics", and one critic he was definitely referring to is Cathy Reisenwitz. Every Cantwell article on Reisenwitz in the two and a half months before the podcast episode discussed race. Furthermore, almost half of the episode is discussing racial issues, and the rest is mostly discussing the critics and infighting that is related to that issue.</p>
<p><strong>6) Woods encouraged Cantwell's racism and gave false information on racial issues during the episode</strong></p>
<p>Woods asked multiple softball questions about race to someone who he knew had a high potential of being racist (see point 4), and in every case, encouraged Cantwell's response. When Cantwell brought up black privilege, Woods agreed, and when the topic was on white privilege, Woods said it led to statism, bringing up a fake story on a racism investigation that painted the opposite picture from reality.</p>
<p><em>And when Woods wrote this response:</em></p>
<p><strong>7) Woods knew that Cantwell was racist or had a high potential of being racist at the time</strong></p>
<p>Woods was reminded in a conversation he was actively participating in, and referenced often, that Cantwell had used a racial slur toward a black person before the podcast took place. This conversation took place only a little over a year beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>8) Woods engaged in bad faith arguments</strong></p>
<p>Woods conflates the Free State Project with Free Talk Live, insinuating that the Free State Project supported Cantwell when he made the episode. The Free State Project specifically says not to conflate them with Free Talk Live, had banned Cantwell at the time, and has since banned the host of Free Talk Live from their events. Woods knew at one point that Cantwell was expelled from the Free State Project, since Cantwell told him. Cantwell also wrote several articles mentioning it, so it is likely he read it.</p>
<p>Woods claims that Cantwell appeared to have shifted toward White Nationalism in 2017, using Ian Freeman as a source. Ian Freeman said the shift started in 2015 in the very article that Woods quotes from.</p>
<p>Woods quotes Freeman's statement that Cantwell had "been a libertarian activist with no known racist streak". Woods knows that there was a high potential that Cantwell was racist at the time (see point 7), and does not address this at all.</p>
